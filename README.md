This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Java: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The code attempts to access an array element beyond its defined bounds.  This example showcases the error and provides a corrected version. The problem lies in the loop condition of the for loop.  Incorrectly using <= instead of <  leads to this exception. Review the solution for a corrected implementation.
